# Deals

## Business Aspects

## Mailing Schedule
- 8 times a year - during major holidays

## App 
- Notification in status bar when new coupons have been add (in-band update)

## Proposed

### Cost Model
- Total cost will be about $160-$170 per month (just AWS)
  - Databases are expensive
    - Replications, backups, snapshots, security zones, VPCs, etc..

- Starts out as a subscription fee, per month
  - $450 a month (base)
  - $550 a month (enhanced customer support)

## Base


## Enhanced
- Approx 3 months after base is relased
- Give time for people to download the app and get views 




### Customer Subscription for Enhanced Functionality
- Apple wallet / Android pay
- Mail metrics to them monthly 
- Ability to request out-of-band coupons uploaded to the app 
  - Notify app users of new coupons 
- Ability to upload more coupon than on print
  - one out-of-band release (up to the franchisee owner)
    - groupon model degrades business value, best of print and availability
